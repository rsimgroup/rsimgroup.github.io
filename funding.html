  <!-- A large part of the complexity and inefficiency in current hardware concurrency mechanisms arguably arises from a software-oblivious approach to hardware design. The DeNovo project seeks to rethink concurrent hardware from the ground up, given the assumption that most future software will use disciplined concurrency models for better dependability. -->
