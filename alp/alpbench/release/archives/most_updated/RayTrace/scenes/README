This directory contains various example scenes in multiple formats.
Some of these scenes require volumetric data sets in order to render
correctly, others require texture maps in order to render correctly.
These are primarily intended as simple examples for people interested
in designing their own scenes.

Most if not all of these scenes should render in under a few minutes
on the current crop of machines.
