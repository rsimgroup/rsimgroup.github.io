	The SWAT project deals with devising low-overhead reliability solutions
	that handle multiple sources of failure.  </p>
    
<p>
As devices continue to scale, future shipped hardware is more likely to fail
due to in-the-field hardware faults. As traditional redundancy-based hardware
reliability solutions are too expensive to be broadly deployable, recent
research has focused on low-overhead reliability solutions. One approach is to
employ detection (always-on) techniques that detect errors due to multiple
sources of failure with a low-overhead and pay a higher overhead for diagnosis
(rarely invoked).
</p>

<p>
To this end, we are developing SWAT (SoftWare Anomaly Treatment) -- a low-cost
firmware-level reliability solution that effectively handles multiple sources
of faults. We observe that detecting the effect of faults through monitoring
anomalous software behavior results in a low-overhead detection scheme that is
capable of handing multiple sources of hardware faults. Our results indicate
that such simple detection schemes detect over 95% of the permanent hardware
faults in the underlying processor. We also show that using more sophisticated
detection schemes, such as using software-level invariants, further improves
this coverage by reducing the advent of SDC events. Post-detection, diagnosis
is required to isolate both the type of fault (hardware or software). In the 
case of a hardware fault, diagnosis is also responsible for  identifying the 
faulty microarchitectural component so that the entire core is not 
decomissioned. We present such a diagnosis framework that exploits a
checkpoint/replay based recovery mechanism to identify the faulty unit. We
show that over 96% of the detected faults can be correctly diagnosed to effect
fine-grain reconfiguration/repair.
</p>

<p>
We continue to expand the SWAT infrastructure to multicore and multithreaded
environments, to enhance the resilience of such systems as well. We envision
that future systems would require low-overhead schemes, such as SWAT, to provide
for heightened resilience with the advent of a plethora of failure modes.
