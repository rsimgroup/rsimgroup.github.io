		<span class="projects"><strong>Overview</strong></span></div>
		<p class="style12"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The SWAT (SoftWare 
		Anomaly Treatment) project at Illinois has developed a novel and 
		extremely low-cost design paradigm for affordable hardware reliability 
		across all segments of the computing market.</span></p>
		<p class="style12"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Devices in shipped 
		chips are increasingly expected to fail for many reasons, threatening 
		future improvements in functionality and performance of computing 
		systems.<span style="mso-spacerun:yes">&nbsp; </span>At the same time, 
		computers are becoming pervasive and society increasingly depends on 
		their reliable operation. Previous solutions for hardware resiliency 
		required significant redundancy and are too expensive to be widely 
		deployed. In contrast, SWAT enables reliable operation at near-zero 
		cost, making reliability affordable and pervasive.
		</span>
		</p>
		<br />
		<p class="style13"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">
		<o:p>&nbsp;<img alt="SWAT image" height="450" src="images/new-swat-image.jpg" width="600" /></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="style12">&nbsp;</p>
		<p class="style12"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">Instead of heavyweight 
		always-on redundant computing, SWAT employs extremely low cost monitors 
		that look for anomalous software behavior as symptoms of hardware 
		faults. In the relatively rare event of such symptom detection, SWAT 
		employs a sophisticated operation to rescue and recover the system from 
		the impact of the fault. Since this rescue happens relatively rarely, it 
		can be done largely in software at very low cost. This is analogous to 
		the deployment of the Special Weapons And Tactics (S.W.A.T.) team that 
		remains latent in the common case, and is called for only in high-risk 
		situations. &nbsp;A SWAT enabled system is thus equipped with very simple, 
		low-cost symptom detectors, a specialized diagnosis procedure that can 
		identify the source of the problem, and a recovery mechanism that can 
		seamlessly recover the system to a fault-free state.<o:p>&nbsp;</o:p></span></p>
		<p class="style12"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">The project has 
		attracted significant interest from industry. Last year, the 
		Semiconductor Research Corporation (SRC), a consortium of semiconductor 
		companies, provided funding for prototyping SWAT as a step towards 
		validation and potential transfer of the technology to industry. 
		Additionally, a SWAT student will be spending several months at Intel to 
		demonstrate SWAT for systems and fault models relevant to Intel. In 
		recognition of the potential of the work, another student received a 
		fellowship from Intel and a scholarship from IBM. We were also able to 
		win a Computing Innovations fellowship grant through which a female 
		postdoctoral student has now joined the SWAT team.<o:p></o:p></span></p>
		<p class="style12"><span style="font-size:10.0pt">In summary, SWAT is 
		addressing a critical challenge, its novel solution strategy is 
		attracting much industry attention, and it has the potential to be a 
		game-changing innovation for not only the microprocessor industry but 
		also for the computing industry at large.</span></p>

			<br /><strong><span class="projects">SWAT Framework Components</span></strong><p class="style12"><br />SWAT has following framework components:<br />
			1.<strong> Detection:</strong> SWAT detects hardware faults by monitoring software 
			misbehavior.<br />
			2. <strong>Recovery:</strong> SWAT relies on a checkpointing mechanism to recover the 
			state of the system. On a detection the system is rolled back to a 
			prestine state. <br />
			3. <strong>Diagnosis:</strong> After detecting a fault a diagnosis 
			procedure is invoked that replays the fault activating trace 
			repeatedly on the faulty hardware to identify the source of the 
			fault. <br />
			4. <strong>Repair:</strong> On diagnosing the source of the fault, 
			appropriate repair action is performed depending on the availability 
			of the redundant hardware components. <br />
			
			All these components are controled by the flexible firmware layer.</p>
