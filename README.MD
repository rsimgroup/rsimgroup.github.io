# How to use the scripts:
1. Only update files in each project's `Sources` folder
2. Run `manage.py` with `python3 manage.py`
3. Currently, project-level `manage_main.py` should not be executed as a module independently -> use `manage.py` instead

# Project Structure:
1. each project has a `Sources` folder that contains
    1. `update_*.py` update each HTML page
    2. `contents_*.html` contains unique content of each HTML page
    3. `base.html` contains the base structure of all html pages in that project
    4. `manage_main.py` the project-level scripts manager
2. the top-level `Sources` folder also contains
    1. `utils/` folder that contains all classes and function definitions
    2. `publication_bibtex/` folder that contains all publications in four BibTex files `msthesis.bib`, `paper.bib`, `phdthesis.bib` and `talk.bib`
    3. `news.json` file, which contains a list of dictionaries
    4. `people.json` file, which is a dictionary of lists of dictionaries -> structure in `people.json` is different from structure in `news.json`
    
 # Data Files Structures:
 1. for `paper.bib` file only
    1. some entries may have two types of fields: 
        - some are standard BibTex fields
        - some have `_`s as prefixes, which denote that those fields are not generated by Google Scholar (considered as a standard here). They have higher precedence when displayed on web page as they represent information that is manually set instead of automatically generated. When entries with this prefix are used as citations, those fields should be excluded
    2. those rules are merely conventions and can be ignored at users' discretion
    
2. no standards are used for other `*.bib` files, so that there are **no fields with `_` prefix**. When they are used as citations/references, users should reformat the entries when necessary
    
3. for `*.json` files
    1. some entries may have `_only_at_` key:
        - this is due to the fact that there are some entries that exists in project-level web pages but not in top level web pages
        - this field is not mandatory (can be omitted)
    2. `projects:[]` should be included in each entry, but it can also be omitted
