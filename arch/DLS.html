<P><A name=hirani></A>Wednesday, August 24<BR>CS Colloquium: Anil N. Hirani, 
UIUC</P>
<P>"Space Mission Design and Discrete Exterior Calculus"</P>
<P>This talk is about trajectory design for low-thrust space missions and about 
Discrete Exterior Calculus (DEC). These seemingly disconnected topics will be 
bridged by a proposed application of DEC to asteroid landing trajectory design. 
The purpose of this talk is to introduce graduate students to the kinds of 
projects available in our research.</P>
<P>The advent of low-thrust spacecraft (which use electric propulsion instead of 
chemical rockets) has infused new and exciting challenges in the field of 
trajectory design. I will describe the use of the circular restricted three-body 
model for designing trajectories for low-thrust missions. In particular I will 
describe our work on computing invariant manifolds for design of capture 
trajectories and our work on modeling stable distant retrograde orbits. I will 
also describe a proposal for using DEC for trajectory design for landing on 
asteroids. DEC was the main content of my thesis work and it is about 
discretizing calculus on manifolds for computational work. After a description 
of this discrete calculus I will describe our work on a numerical study of 
convergence of discrete Laplace-Beltrami operator, and motivate another proposed 
DEC applications in space stuff, but this time to magnetohydrodynamics for 
astrophysics applications.<BR><BR>Bio: Anil Hirani completed his Ph.D in 
Computer Science with minors in Mathematics and Control and Dynamical Systems 
from California Institute of Technology in 2003. He then spent a year as a 
postdoc in Control and Dynamical Systems followed by a year as an engineer in 
the Jet Propulsion Lab (JPL). His thesis dealt with the discretization of 
exterior calculus and his work at JPL involved design of trajectories for space 
missions and the design and implementation of tools to do the same. In 
particular he worked on the trajectories and tools for the Jupiter Icy Moons 
Orbiter, a low-thrust, nuclear electric propulsion spacecraft. Before Caltech, 
Anil worked at Sony Research Center in Tokyo in image processing and at Sun 
Microsystems in Mountain View in computer graphics. Before that he obtained his 
MS in Computer Science (theory track) at Stanford and his undergraduate degree 
in Computer Science at BITS, Pilani, India. Starting this fall he is an 
Assistant Professor of Computer Science at the University of Illinois at 
Urbana-Champaign.</P>

<P><A name=Sinha></A>August 29<BR>CS Colloquium: Saurabh Sinha, UIUC</P>
<P>With the completion (and anticipated completion) of genomes of a wide variety 
of organisms, there is now an abundance of sequence data that needs to be 
analyzed in order to extract useful biological knowledge. In many cases, several 
closely related species (such as different varieties of fruitflies) have been 
sequenced, with the explicit goal of cross-species comparison to facilitate 
analysis. Therefore, development of accurate and efficient algorithms to perform 
this multi-species analysis of genomic data has become imperative.</P>
<P>In this talk, we will explore some probabilistic approaches to the 
above-mentioned problem, and in particular, to the understanding of gene 
regulation. Probabilistic constructs such as Hidden Markov Models will be shown 
to have a natural (biochemically relevant) application in this context. When 
combined with a realistic mathematical model of evolution, the HMM will present 
itself as a powerful framework for multi-species genome analysis, with provision 
to systematically deal with biological noise and missing data. Finally, the talk 
will chalk out potential research projects that address many pressing questions 
in bioinformatics today, within the probabilistic framework presented.</P>
<P>The biological concepts used will be explained during the talk.</P>
<P>Bio: Saurabh Sinha's research interest is in the field of computational 
biology, with focus on the design of algorithms for the study of regulatory 
sequences in the genome. He obtained his Ph.D. in Computer Science &amp; Engg., 
at the University of Washington, Seattle (2002), and was a post-doctoral fellow 
at the Center for Studies in Physics and Biology, Rockefeller University, New 
York (2002-2005).</P>

<P>"Improving the Reliability of Commodity Operating Systems"</P>
<P>Despite decades of research in extensible operating system technology, 
extensions such as device drivers remain a significant cause of system failures. 
In Windows XP, for example, drivers account for 85% of recently reported 
failures.</P>
<P>This talk describes Nooks, a reliability subsystem that seeks to greatly 
enhance OS reliability by isolating the OS from driver failures. The Nooks 
approach is practical: rather than guaranteeing complete fault tolerance through 
a new (and incompatible) OS or driver architecture, our goal is to prevent the 
vast majority of driver-caused crashes with little or no change to existing 
driver and system code. </P>
<P>We have implemented a Nooks prototype on the Linux operating system. Our 
results show that Nooks offers a substantial increase in the reliability of 
operating systems, catching and quickly recovering from many faults that would 
otherwise crash the system. Under a wide range of fault conditions, we show that 
Nooks recovers automatically from 99% of the faults that otherwise cause Linux 
to crash.</P>
<P>Bio: Hank Levy is Professor and Wissner-Slivka Chair of Computer Science and 
Engineering at the University of Washington. Levy’s research involves operating 
systems, computer architecture, distributed computing, and the Web. His 
publications include 2 books and 11 best-paper award winners from top systems 
conferences. With his UW colleagues, he invented Simultaneous Multithreading, 
which is used in the Intel Pentium-4 (“Hyperthreading”) and IBM Power-5 CPUs. 
Hank is a Fellow of the ACM, a Fellow of the IEEE, and recipient of a Fulbright 
Research Scholar Award. He was closely involved in the design and construction 
of the new Paul G. Allen Center for Computer Science &amp; Engineering at UW, 
and is now curator for the building’s UW-focused art collection.</P>

UIUC</P>
<P>"Architectural, Systems, and Analytic Challenges in Sensor Networks"</P>
<P>Current embedded software systems are increasing in scale, distribution, 
transparency to the user, and degree of interaction with their physical 
environment. The "Embedded Everywhere" vision, recently articulated by the 
National Academy of Sciences, predicts a new era of ubiquitous 
networked<BR>embedded computing devices and calls for a coordinated research 
agenda to address this trend. The recent explosive activity in the sensor 
networks area is a first manifestation of this vision. This talk reviews major 
challnges in sensor networks, both from a systems perspective and a theory 
perspective.<BR>The needs for run-time services, development tools, programming 
paradigms, and underlying analytic foundations are described to support emerging 
sensor networks applications. Examples of practical applications are presented, 
including one transitioned at the speaker's previous institution to the 
Defense<BR>Intelligence Agency. Also, some theoretical results are highlighted 
including real-time capacity of sensor networks derived using the speaker's 
recent timing analysis framework for distributed embedded software systems. The 
talk concludes with major unsolved problems, directions, and opportunities for 
future rsearch. </P>
<P>Bio:<BR>Tarek Abdelzaher received his B.Sc. and M.Sc. degrees in Electrical 
and Computer Engineering from Ain Shams University, Cairo, Egypt, in 1990 and 
1994 respectively. He received his Ph.D. from the University of Michigan in 1999 
on Quality of Service Adaptation in Real-Time Systems. He has been an Assistant 
Professor at the University of Virginia until his promotion with tenure in 2005, 
where he founded the Software Predictability Group. He is currently an Associate 
Professor at the Department of Computer Science, the University of Illinois at

60 refereed publications in leading conferences and journals in several fields 
including real-time computing, distributed systems, sensor networks, and 
control. He is an Associate Editor of the IEEE Transactions on Mobile Computing, 
the Journal of Real-Time Systems, the International Journal of Embedded Systems 
and the Ad Hoc Networks Journal, as well as Editor of ACM SIGBED Review. He was 
Guest Editor for the Journal of Computer Communications and the Journal of 
Real-Time Systems, and is Co-Editor of IEEE Distributed Systems Online. He 
served on numerous technical program committees in real-time computing, 
networking, quality of service, distributed systems, sensor networks,

<P>"The Art &amp; Science of Embedded Multimedia Systems Design: A 
Communication-Centric Perspective"</P>
<P>Multimedia represents the dominant application in many embedded systems 
ranging from set-top boxes to mobile phones and PDAs. Most of these systems are 
being designed using generic multiprocessor platforms rather than starting from 
scratch. Such design platforms are difficult to optimize but, being primarily 
targeted to a particular application domain, offer the promise of flexibility, 
low costs and time-to-market advantages. Consequently, significant research 
efforts are currently directed towards narrowing down the performance gap 
between these platform-based designs and the fully customized solutions based on 
traditional ASIC implementations.<BR><BR>This talk will bring a 
communication-centric perspective to this emerging research area and emphasize 
some research issues where the concept of "network" is at the forefront of 
embedded multimedia processing. We hope to impart the essence of the theoretical 
foundations, design implications and appropriate design methods for using the 
network paradigm to solve real problems in multimedia. To this end, we discuss 
several performance models and optimization techniques that can be used to 
quantitatively analyze different architectures, while reasoning about 
performance, energy, QoS requirements and media quality tradeoffs.</P>

software tools for system-on-chip design, on-chip communication, and ambient 
intelligence. </P>
<P>Radu Marculescu received the NSF CAREER Award in 2001 in the area of design 
automation of electronic systems. He won the 2005 Transactions on Very Large 
Scale Integration Systems (T-VLSI) Best Paper Award from the IEEE Circuits and 
Systems (CAS) Society, and several Best Paper Awards from the Design Automation 
and Test in Europe (DATE) Conference and Asia South Pacific Design Automation 
Conference (ASP-DAC) in 2001 and 2003.<BR>He was also awarded the Carnegie

Labs</P>
<P>"Metric Space Epsilon-nets and Their Applications"</P>
<P>Metric spaces are very simple geometric structures: they comprise a set and a 
distance measure that obeys the triangle inequality. Epsilon-nets, also called 
"low-dispersion sets" or "farthest-point <BR>samples", are subsets of metric 
spaces that are "well-distributed" in a certain sense. They can be found 
efficiently using a greedy algorithm. This talk will review that algorithm, and 
briefly survey applications of <BR>epsilon-nets in motion planning, nearest 
neighbor searching, building meshes to approximate curves and surfaces, and 
building triangulations to approximate functions<BR></P>
<P>Bio: Kenneth L. Clarkson received a B.A. in mathematics from Pomona College, 
and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from Stanford University. Since October 1984 he 
has been a member of the technical staff at Bell Laboratories. His work focuses 
on algorithmic problems in a geometric setting, such as nearest-neighbor 
searching and computing convex hulls, but has also included work in optimization 
of cellular phone systems and backbone networks. He introduced a framework for 
the use of randomization in geometric algorithms that is similar to, but not the 
same as, the VC dimension.</P>

<P>"Dynamic Network Analysis Applied to Counter Terrorism"</P>
<P>Dynamic network analysis (DNA) is an emergent field centered on the 
collection, analysis, understanding and prediction of dynamic relations (such as 
who talks to whom and who knows what) and the impact of such dynamics on 
individual and group behavior. DNA facilitates reasoning about real groups as 
complex dynamic systems that evolve over time. In this talk, a basic tool chain 
for DNA is described and then their use is illustrated by examining al 
Qaeda.Technology described enables the analyst to identify vulnerabilities in 
the terrorist network and to assess how that network might change in response to 
strategic interventions.</P>
<P>Bio:<BR>Kathleen Carley, is a professor at the Institute for Software 
Research International in the School of Computer Science at Carnegie Mellon

<P><A name=vardi></A>October 31<BR>Distinguished Lecture: Moshe Vardi, Rice 
University<BR><BR>"And Logic Begat Computer Science: When Giants Roamed the 
Earth"<BR><BR>During the past fifty years there has been extensive, continuous, 
and growing interaction between logic and computer science. In fact, logic has 
been called "the calculus of computer science". The argument is that logic plays 
a fundamental role in computer science, similar to that played by calculus in 
the physical sciences and traditional engineering disciplines. Indeed, logic 
plays an important role in areas of computer science as disparate as 
architecture (logic gates), software engineering (specification and 
verification), programming languages (semantics, logic programming), databases 
(relational algebra and SQL), artificial intelligence (automated theorem 
proving), algorithms (complexity and expressiveness), and theory of computation 
(general notions of computability). This non-technical talk will provide an 
overview of the unusual effectiveness of logic in computer science by surveying 
the history of logic in computer science, going back all the way to Aristotle 
and Euclid, and showing how logic actually gave rise to computer science.</P>

CS Colloquium: Liviu Iftode, Rutgers
<P>&quot;Building Defensive Architectures Using Backdoors&quot;</P>
<P>As computers are becoming ubiquitous, more human activities will depend on 
  their availability and survivability to failures and attacks. In the face of 
  increasing systems complexity, attack sophistication and user impatience,<br>
  human intervention for their monitoring, repairing, and recovery is often too 
  costly and critically slow.</P>
<p>In this talk, I introduce our approach of building defensive computer systems 
  capable of performing healing activities on themselves automatically. This can 
  be achieved by augmenting their hardware and software with trusted intelligent 
  backdoors. An intelligent backdoor can be programmed to perform observation, 
  detection and intervention on a computer system automatically and without involving 
  its operating system. It can also communicate with other backdoors for cooperative 
  healing. Backdoors can be realized in hardware using a programmable network 
  interface or in software over a virtual machine monitor. In this talk, I present 
  two defensive architectures. The first one uses a hardware backdoor implementation 
  to perform remote healing across a cluster of Internet servers. The second architecture 
  uses a software backdoor implemented on a virtual machine<br>

Distinguished Lecture: James Larus, Microsoft
<P>"An Overview of the Singularity Project"</P>
<P>Singularity is a research project in Microsoft Research that started with the 
question: what would a software platform look like if it was designed from 
scratch with the primary goal of dependability? Singularity is working to answer 
this question by building on advances in programming languages and tools to 
develop a new system architecture and operating system (named Singularity), with 
the aim of producing a more robust and dependable software platform. Singularity 
demonstrates the practicality of new technologies and architectural decisions, 
which should lead to the construction of more robust and dependable systems.</P>
<P>Bio: Currently a Research Area Manager in Microsoft Research, overseeing the 
Software Improvement Group (SWIG), which consists of the ACT, HIP, RAD, and RSS 
research groups, and running the Singularity research project. At Microsoft 
Research, Dr. Larus started and, for five years, led the Software Productivity 
Tools (SPT) group, which is one of the most innovative and productive groups 
currently working in the area of program analysis and programming tools. Before 
joining Microsoft, Dr. Larus was an Associate Professor at the University of 
Wisconsin-Madison, where he co-led the Wisconsin Wind Tunnel research project 
with Professors Mark Hill and David Wood. This DARPA and NSF-funded project 
investigated new approaches to building and programming parallel shared-memory 
computers. Dr. Larus received his PhD from the University of California, 
Berkeley in 1989.</P>

Distinguished Lecture: Jonathan Grudin, Microsoft
<P>"Emerging Technologies and Knowledge Management"</P>
<P>Lightweight new technologies are emerging rapidly. Some are rapidly adopted 
by millions of students, at least for a time. As these students enter the 
workforce, they will bring different skills and with identities formed through 
these technologies. I have been examining how some of these technologies are 
starting to be used. I will describe some interesting possibilities for 
overcoming past obstacles to managing asynchronous information and knowledge. 
I’ll review past impediments and demonstrate how features of unstructured 
tagging, weblogs, and search can address them.</P>
<P>After considering the more general issue of why rapid shifts in technology 
use have taken people (including me) by surprise, and often not been understood 
until later, I’ve found evidence in the literature that suggests that our focus 
on conceptual development and our use of misleading visualizations are 
contributing factors. I will conclude by briefly presenting visualizations that 
might address these problems and affect how we look at the relationship between 
technology and behavior</P>

<p>&quot;Gender, Lies and Video Games: the Truth about Females and Computing&quot;</p>
<p>This talk explores how girls and women differ from boys and men in their uses 
  of and attitudes towards computers and computing. From playing computer games 
  to pursuing computing careers, the participation of females tends to be very 
  low compared to that of males. Why is this? Opinions range from girls wanting 
  to avoid the math and/or the geek image of programming to girls having better 
  things to do with their lives. We discuss research findings on this issue, as 
  well as initiatives designed to increase the participation of females in computing.</p>
<p>Bio: Maria Klawe, dean of Princeton University's School of Engineering and 
  Applied Science for the past three years, has been selected to become president 
  of Harvey Mudd College, effective July 1, 2006. Maria will be the first woman 
  to serve as President of Harvey Mudd College, a liberal arts college focusing 
  on engineering, science and mathematics education founded in 1955 as one of 
  The Claremont Colleges in Claremont, Calif. </p>
<p>Maria came to Princeton from the University of British Columbia where she held 
  posts including dean of science, vice president of student and academic services, 
  and head of the Department of Computer Science. Maria&#8217;s rich career also 
  includes eight years with IBM Research in California. She received her Ph.D. 
  and B.S. in Mathematics from the University of Alberta.</p>
<p>Maria has made significant research contributions in several areas of mathematics 
  and computer science. She was the founder and director of the Electronic Games 
  for Education in Math and Science, a project which explores the use of computer 
  games in enhancing mathematics education for grades 4 through 9 and studies 
  the effect of gender in technology-based learning environments, and made seminal 
  developments in educational software. </p>

  Distinguished Lecture: Hector Levesque, Univ. of Toronto</p>
<P>&quot;Planning with Loops&quot;</P>
<P>Automatically generating plans of action remains a central problem in AI research. 
  Unlike the case for sequential and conditional planning, much of the work on 
  iterative planning (planning where loops may be needed) leans<br>
  heavily on theorem-proving. In this talk we do the following: propose a different 
  approach where generating plans is decoupled from verifying them; describe the 
  implementation of an iterative planner based on the language of<br>
  the situation calculus; present a few examples illustrating the sorts of plans 
  that can be generated; show some of the strengths and weaknesses of the approach; 
  and finally sketch the beginnings of a theory, where validation of<br>
  plans is done offline.</P>
<p>Bio: Hector Levesque received his Ph. D. from the University of Toronto in 
  1981. After graduation, he accepted a position at the Fairchild Lab for AI Research 
  in Palo Alto, and then joined the faculty at the University of Toronto where 
  he has remained since 1984. Dr. Levesque has published over 60 research papers, 
  and is the co-author of a recent textbook on knowledge representation and reasoning. 
  In 1985, he received the Computers and Thought Award given by IJCAI. He is a 
  founding fellow of the AAAI, and was a co-founder of the<br>
  International Conference on Principles of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. 
  In 2001, Dr. Levesque was the Conference Chair of IJCAI-01, and served as President 
  of the Board of Trustees of IJCAI from 2001 to 2003.</p>

<p>&quot;The Future of Compilers for Parallel Architectures, from Systems-on-a-Chip 
  to Supercomputers&quot;</p>
<p>In recent years, many computer architects have been heralding the end of an 
  era for boosting clock speeds and increasing instruction-level-parallelism in 
  future microprocessors. The movement towards multi-core microprocessors is upon 
  us, begging the obvious question, &quot;How will we develop applications for 
  these small-scale parallel computers?&quot; Decades of research in high-end 
  computing have yielded solutions that rely on heroic application programmers, 
  and might not be appropriate as<br>
  parallel computing reaches the masses.</p>
<p>In this talk, we discuss the role of parallelizing compiler technology, originally 
  developed for high-end computing, in bridging this parallel programming gap. 
  The talk will cover several aspects of the issue. We demonstrate the power of 
  a few key compiler optimizations in targeting a variety of architectural features, 
  including FPGAs, SIMD multimedia extension architectures and the complex memory 
  hierarchies of conventional architectures. We examine the very structure of 
  today's compilers, which are currently monolithic and difficult to retarget 
  to new architectures, and propose a systematic and principled strategy to compiler 
  optimization. We also consider how new programming models, coupled with compiler 
  technology, can increase the productivity of parallel programmers.</p>

<p>&quot;The Stanford Data Stream Management System&quot;</p>
<p>This talk will describe our development of the Stanford Stream Data Manager 
  (STREAM), a system for executing complex continuous queries over multiple continuous 
  data streams. The STREAM system supports a<br>
  declarative query language, it copes with high data rates and query workloads 
  by providing approximate answers when resources are limited, and it adapts its 
  execution strategies automatically as conditions change. We will provide an 
  overview of the system and our research results, and show a live demo assuming 
  time and logistics permit.</p>
<p>Joint work with the entire STREAM group at Stanford: http://infolab.stanford.edu/stream</p>
<p>Jennifer Widom is a Professor in the Computer Science and Electrical Engineering 
  Departments at Stanford University. She received her Bachelors degree from the 
  Indiana University School of Music in 1982<br>
  and her Computer Science Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1987. She was a Research 
  Staff Member at the IBM Almaden Research Center before joining the Stanford 
  faculty in 1993. Her research interests span many<br>
  aspects of nontraditional data management. She is an ACM Fellow and a member
