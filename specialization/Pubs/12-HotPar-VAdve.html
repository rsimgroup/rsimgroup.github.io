<h2>Abstract:</h2>
<blockquote>
Developing software applications for emerging and future heterogeneous systems
with diverse combinations of
hardware is signiÔ¨Åcantly harder than for homogeneous
multicore systems. In this paper, we identify three root
causes that underlie the programming challenges: (1) diverse parallelism models;
(2) diverse memory architectures; and (3) diverse hardware instruction set
semantics. We believe that these issues must be addressed using a
language-neutral, virtual instruction set layer that
abstracts away most of the low-level details of hardware,
an approach we call Virtual Instruction Set Computing.
Most importantly, the virtual instruction set must abstract away and unify the
diverse forms of parallelism
and memory architectures using only one or two models
of parallelism. We discuss how this approach can solve
the root causes of the programmability challenges, illustrate the design with an
example, and discuss the research
challenges that arise in realizing this vision.
