	{ The article describes the various design decisions in the IBM z-series system and the Tandem Non-stop server to improve
		availability of the systems,
		and the various changes that were brought about as the demands of reliability and technology changed. IBM
		adopts a fine grain kind of redundancy, by duplicating elements within each processor core, 
		while the Tandem system develops around the idea loosely coupled multi-processors. 
		It also presents the trade-offs involved in the design choices, and how it affects the performance of these
		systems.},
