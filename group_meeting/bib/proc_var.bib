	{This paper defines the new challenges as technology scales: transistor variability, soft-error, and device degradation. The sources of variation include random dopant fluctuations, sub-wavelength lithography, and heat flux. Instead of the current deterministic approach, the author urges future designs to employ probabilistic approaches that consider variations and optimize for yield, performance, and power. The paper also project the large device variations (in Vt), high soft-error rate, and high degradation rate. In order to design a reliable system, future architectures can no longer rely on one-time field tests. Instead, resilient microarchitectures that self-detect and self-correct errors could ensure the reliaiblity of future systems.},

	{This paper explains how variations in process, voltage, and temperature (P, V, T) are creating challenges for future processor designs. Process variation results in chips with different frequencies and leakages. Voltage variation causes different levels of power dissipation on chip. Temperature variation affects both the device and interconnect performance. Fortunately, there are techniques that battle these challenges. Larger transistors and dual Vt designs can increase the probability of achieving target frequency by trading off with higher power consumption. Forward body bias and Reverse body bias can increase the frequency and reduce the leakage, respectively. The combined technique, adaptive body bias, can be applied in die-to-die and with-die cases to achieve both goals. Further, adaptive Vcc can also reduces the variation effects. However, these design techniques need to be incorporated into future probabilistic design approaches to effectively combat challenges posed by process variation.},
